# OnlineInfoOlympiad
A client-server application made in C++ for linux that let's you run a programming contest in C++. My project for the Computer Networks course in 2018. It has at it's core the main idea as programming sites such as https://infoarena.ro/ or http://campion.edu.ro/index.php but the client is on a linux console instead of a web page. It can also be used to run automatically noted exams for a C++ course, for example. </br>
It has been done using directly linux sockets, we weren't allowed to use any kind of frameworks or libraries.
</br>
For more information about how to set up and use the client and server please read the README.txt inside each one of them.
